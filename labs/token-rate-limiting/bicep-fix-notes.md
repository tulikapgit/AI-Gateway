## API Version Mapping

| Resource | Original Version | Updated Version | Reason |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Microsoft.ApiManagement/service | 2023-05-01/2024-05-01 | 2021-12-01-preview | Ensure regional availability |
| Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis | 2023-05-01/2024-05-01 | 2021-12-01-preview | Ensure regional availability |
| Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/apis/policies | 2022-08-01 | 2021-12-01-preview | Consistency with other resources |
| Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/backends (with circuit breaker) | 2022-08-01 | 2022-09-01-preview | Circuit breaker support |
| Microsoft.ApiManagement/service/backends (backend pool) | varies | 2021-12-01-preview | Support for type and pool properties |

## How to Verify Success

After applying these changes:
1. Run the deployment and confirm it completes without API version errors
2. Verify the OpenAI API is accessible through API Management
3. Test the token rate limiting functionality by running the test cells in the notebook

## Additional Considerations

These changes ensure compatibility across all Azure regions without modifying the actual functionality of the lab. The token rate limiting policy (`azure-openai-token-limit`) and its configuration remain unchanged.
